I am a graduate student at Virginia Tech (VT) in
Genetics, Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology ([GBCB][gbcb])
doing statistics, computer science, and life science.
My PhD is
[up][bi-vt-uva-2018-07-31]

[at][bi-vt-uva-2019-09-21-1]
[the][bi-vt-uva-2019-09-21-2]
moment,
but I'm hoping work on machine learning model evaluation,
and looking to help health practitioners understand and work with data better.

[Arch Linux][arch] user and maintain the
[RStudio Preview][aur-rstudio],
[nteract][aur-nteract], and
[Rodeo][aur-rodeo]
packages in the [AUR][aur].

Enjoys: photography, curling, snowboarding, and scuba diving into caves.
